## Classification Project

**Project Goal:**

Interns will gain practical experience with classification techniques, focusing on categorizing data into predefined classes. Through this project, interns will develop skills in:

* Data preprocessing
* Model selection based on problem and data characteristics
* Training and evaluating classification models
* Understanding key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

**Project Outline:**

The project follows a step-by-step approach to classification:

1. **Data Preparation:**
    * Preprocess the chosen dataset by:
        * Handling missing values
        * Encoding categorical variables
        * Scaling numerical features
2. **Model Selection:**
    * Explore different classification algorithms:
        * Logistic Regression
        * Decision Trees
        * Support Vector Machines
    * Based on the problem and data characteristics, select the most suitable algorithm.
3. **Model Training:**
    * Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    * Train the chosen model on the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as:
        * Accuracy
        * Precision
        * Recall
        * F1-score
    * Employ techniques like cross-validation to assess the model's generalization ability.

**Pro Tips:**

* Explore ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting to potentially improve performance.
* Utilize hyperparameter tuning techniques like grid search or random search to optimize your model.
